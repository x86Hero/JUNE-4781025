linting / linters - help write code in a way it should look
when using 'pylint', it has an alphanumeric priority system - C0101, C0303 etc. C stands for convention.
the warnings issues will be marked W0101 etc - these should be a priority fix. W stands for warning.
then there are E0602 etc - these are the most important, these issues will fail the code run. E stands for Error.

Pylinters will also score your code out of 10
